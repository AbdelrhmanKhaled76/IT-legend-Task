###Project for IT Legend â€” Next.js Website

I developed a full-stack web application for IT Legend as part of a technical skills demonstration, leveraging the Next.js framework with a strong emphasis on best practices and clean architecture.

Key highlights of the project:

Utilized client components for dynamic, interactive user interfaces.

Implemented server components to efficiently manage metadata and server-side logic.

Employed React Context API (useContext) along with useState for scalable and maintainable state management across the application.

Made extensive and effective use of useEffect for side effects and lifecycle control.

Designed and built three custom popups to enhance user interactions and experience.

Structured the project with a well-organized and scalable folder architecture, ensuring ease of maintenance and future development.

Developed a dedicated API route to handle feedback form submissions, connecting to a MongoDB database securely.

Styled the entire application using Tailwind CSS, achieving a modern, responsive, and highly customizable UI.

This project demonstrates my ability to build real-world, production-ready applications using modern Next.js features, manage both frontend and backend concerns, and create a smooth user experience with strong attention to performance and code quality.
